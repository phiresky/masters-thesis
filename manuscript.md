# Abstract {.unnumbered .page_break_before}


Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is an emerging field in reinforcement
learning with real world applications such as unmanned aerial vehicles,
search-and-rescue, and warehouse organization. There are many different
approaches for applying the methods used for single-agent reinforcement learning
to MARL. In this work, we survey different learning methods and environment
properties and then focus on a problem that persists through most variants of
MARL: How should one agent use the information gathered from a large and varying
number of observations of the world in order to make decisions? We focus on
three different methods for aggregating observations and compare them regarding
their training performance and sample efficiency. We introduce a policy
architecture for aggregation based on Bayesian conditioning and compare it to
mean aggregation and attentive aggregation used in related work. We show the
performance of the different methods on a set of cooperative tasks that can
scale to a large number of agents, including tasks that have other objects in
the world that need to be observed by the agents in order to solve the task.

We optimize the hyperparameters to be able to show which parameters lead to the
best results for each of the methods. In addition, we compare different variants
of Bayesian aggregation and compare the recently introduced Trust Region Layers
learning method to the commonly used Proximal Policy Optimization.


# Introduction

Ant colonies, bee swarms, fish colonies, and migrating birds all exhibit
swarming behavior to achieve a common goal or to gain an advantage over what's
possible alone. Each individual within a swarm usually only has limited
perception, and often there is no central control that enforces a common goal or
gives instructions. Swarms of animals can self-organize and exhibit complex
emergent behavior in spite of the limited intelligence, limited perception, and
limited strength of every individual.

In recent years and with the advent of deep reinforcement learning, it has
become possible to create artificial agents that solve fairly complex tasks in
simulated environments as well as in the real world, even when the path to the
goal is difficult to identify and the reward is sparse. Most of the research,
however, is focused on a single agent interacting with a world, and giving the
single agent as much power and flexibility as it needs to solve the task. Akin
to animal swarms, which often consist of fairly simple and limited individuals,
we focus on simple artificial agents that need to cooperate to solve a common
task, where the task is either difficult or impossible for an individual agent.
The agents thus need to be able to learn to work together and to act even with
the limited information they are able to perceive.

Swarms of artificial agents can have multiple applications, some inspired by
swarms in the animal kingdom, some going beyond. Robots can be used in logistics
to organize warehouses. Swarms of robots can be used to map out dangerous areas,
solve mazes, find trapped or injured people in search-and-rescue missions
quicker and more safely than humans
[@{https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s43154-021-00048-3}]. Swarms of
walking robots could be used for animal shepherding
[@{https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9173524}]. Drone swarms can be
used for entertainment in light shows
[@{https://doi.org/10.3929/ethz-a-010831954}], for advertising, for autonomous
surveillance [@{https://doi.org/10.1117/12.830408}], or they could be weaponized
and used as military robots [@{https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/citations/AD1039921}].
Further in the future, swarms of nanobots could be used in medicine to find and
target specific cells in the body
[@{https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7568316}]. Swarms of autonomous
spacecraft can be used to explore space, to harvest resources, and to terraform
planets into paperclips
[@{https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00146-018-0845-5}].

Swarms of homogenous agents can be very resilient. Since they can be designed
such that no one individual is a critical component of the swarm as a whole,
individual failures do not necessarily result in a critical collapse of the
whole swarm.

Robots can be controlled by explicit algorithmic behaviour, but that can be
complicated, inflexible and fragile, as is shown by the success in recent
applications of reinforcmeent learning to control tasks that have not been
solved by pre-programmed algorithms [@{https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.00177}].
Controlling robot swarms using policies learned with deep reinforcement learning
shows promising results in recent literature such as [@openai].

To apply deep reinforcement learning to multi-agent systems, we need to make a
few adjustments to the existing learning algorithms and figure out how best to
design the policy network. Specifically, we need a way to feed a large and
varying amount of observations from the neighboring agents into the fixed size
input of the dense neural network representing the policy. In this work, we
consider three aggregation methods on a set of different multi-agent tasks: Mean
aggregation, Bayesian aggregation, and attentive aggregation. Our main goal is
to compare these methods with regard to their training performance and sample
efficiency. We limit ourselves to a specific subset of MARL tasks that are fully
cooperative with a team reward and with homogenous agents in a
centralized-learning/decentralized-execution setup.

We first give an overview over all the preliminaries we need for our work in
@sec:preliminaries, including reinforcement learning in general, the multi-agent
extensions for reinforcement learning, and the background for the aggregation
methods we use. Next, we describe some related work in @sec:relatedwork. Then,
we describe our contribution in @sec:contribution with details about the policy
architecture and the specifics for the different aggregation methods. Our
experimental setup, including the specific environments we use to carry out our
experiments are described in @sec:experiments. Finally, we show and interpret
the results of our experiments in @sec:results and talk about the conclusions we
can draw from the experiments as well as the potential for future work in
@sec:conclusion.


# Preliminaries {#sec:preliminaries}

In this chapter, we introduce the preliminaries we need for our work. We
describe reinforcement learning and two specific policy gradient training
methods used for deep reinforcement learning in general and then the specifics
of RL for multi-agent systems, including the need for information aggregation
and the different methods we consider.

## Reinforcement learning

Reinforcement learning is a method of training an artificial agent to solve a
task in an environment. As opposed to supervised learning, there is no explicit
label / path to a solution. Instead, the agent iteratively takes actions that
affect its environment, and receives a reward when specific conditions are met.
The reward can be dense (positive or negative signal at every step) or very
sparse (only a binary reward at the end of an episode).

Reinforcement learning problems are usually defined as Markov Decision Processes
(MDPs). An MDP is an extension of a Markov chain, which is a set of states with
a transition probability between each pair of states. The probability only
depends on the current state, not the previous states.

MDPs extend Markov chains, adding a set of actions (that allow an agent to
influence the transition to the next state) and rewards (that motivate the
agent). An MDP thus consists of:

- A set of states $S$ (the _state space_)
- A set of actions $A$ (the _action space_)
- The transition probability that a specific action in a specific state leads to
  specific second state $T(s,a,s') = P(s'|s,a)$
- The reward function that specifies the immediate reward an agent receives
  depending on the previous state, the action, and the new state
  $R: S Ã A Ã S â \mathbb{R}$

The MDP can either run for an infinite period or finish after a number of
transitions. The transition function then always returns the same state.

The method by which an agent chooses its actions based on the current state is
called a _policy_ $Ï$. The policy defines a probability for taking each action
based on a specific state.

Based on a policy we can also define the _Q-value function_ and the _value
function_. The value function $V^Ï$ is the sum of all future expected rewards
that an agent gets based on an initial state $s_t$ and a specific policy Ï that
leads to expected rewards $r$ in each future time step $t+i$ when sampling
actions according to the policy:

$$V^Ï(s_t) = \mathop{\mathbb{E}}\left[\sum_{i=0}^\infty Î³^i r_{t+i} \right]$$

The value function can include an exponential decay $Î³$ for weighing future
rewards, which is especially useful if the horizon is infinite. The Q-value
function is the same except that the action at step $t$ is fixed to $a_t$
instead of chosen by the policy:

$$Q^Ï(s_t,a_t) = \mathop{\mathbb{E}}\left[\sum_{i=0}^â Î³^i r_{t+i} \right]$$

Often we need to extend MDPs to allow for an observation model: A _partially
observable Markov decision process_ (POMDP) is an extension to MDPs that
introduces an indirection between the set of states and the input to the policy
(called an _observation_). In the definition of a POMDP a set of observations is
added with a probability of each state leading to a specific observation. The
policy now depends on the observation and the action instead of the state and
the action. An observation does not necessarily include all the information from
the corresponding state, which leads to naming "partially observable".

To successfully solve a reinforcement learning task, we need to find a policy
that has a high expected reward â we want to find the _optimal policy function_
that has the highest _value_ on the initial states of our environment. Since
finding the optimal policy directly is impossible for even slightly complicated
tasks, we instead use optimization techniques.

## Actor-critic training methods

Policy gradient training methods are a reinforcement learning technique that
optimize the parameters of a policy using gradient descent. Actor-critic methods
optimize both the policy and an estimation of the value function at the same
time.

There are multiple commonly used actor critic training methods such as Trust
Region Policy Optimization (TRPO)
[@{http://proceedings.mlr.press/v37/schulman15.html}], Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO) [@ppo] and Soft Actor Critic
[@{https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.01290}]. We run most of our experiments with one
of the most commonly used methods (PPO) and also explore a new method that
promises stabler training (PG-TRL [@trl]).

### Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)

[@ppo]: https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.06347

Proximal Policy Optimization [@ppo] is an actor-critic policy gradient method
for reinforcement learning. In PPO, each training step consists of collecting a
set of trajectory rollouts, then optimizing a "surrogate" objective function
using stochastic gradient descent. The surrogate objective function approximates
the policy gradient while enforcing a trust region by clipping the update steps.
PPO is a successor to Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO) with a simpler
implementation and empirically better performance.

PPO optimizes the policy using

$$Î¸_{k+1} = \text{argmax}_{Î¸} E_{s,a \sim Ï_{Î¸_k}} [L(s, a, Î¸_k, Î¸)]$$

Where $Ï_{Î¸_k}$ is a policy with parameters $Î¸$ in training step $k$, $s$ is the
state, $a\sim Ï_{Î¸_k}$ is the action distribution according to the policy at
step $k$, and $Îµ=0.2$ is a hyperparameter. $L$ is given by

$$L(s,a,Î¸_k,Î¸) = \min \left( \frac{Ï_Î¸(a|s)}{Ï_{Î¸_k}(a|s)} A^{Ï_{Î¸_k}}(s,a), \text{clip}(\frac{Ï_Î¸(a|s)}{Ï_{Î¸_k}(a|s)}, 1 - Îµ, 1 + Îµ) A^{Ï_{Î¸_k}}(s,a) \right).$$

The advantage $A$ is defined as $A^{Ï}(s,a) = Q^Ï(s,a) - V^Ï(s)$ and is
estimated using Generalized Advantage Estimation
[@{https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02438}] based on the estimated value function.

We use PPO as the default for most of our experiments since it is widely used in
other deep reinforcement learning work.

### Trust Region Layers (PG-TRL) {#sec:trl}

Differentiable trust region layers are an alternative method to enforce a trust
region during policy updates introduced by @trl. PPO uses a fixed clipping ratio
to enforce the trust region, which can result in unstable training. Instead of
using a fixed clipping boundary, in PG-TRL a surrogate policy is created with a
new layer at the end that projects the unclipped policy back into the trust
region. The trust region and the projection is based on either the KL-divergence
[@doi:10.1214/aoms/1177729694] or the Wasserstein $W_2$ distance
[@{https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783540710493}].

After each training step, the projected new policy depends on the previous
policy. To prevent an infinite stacking of old policies, the explicitly
projected policy is only used as a surrogate, while the real policy is based on
a learned approximation. To prevent the real policy and the projected policy
from diverging, the divergence between them is computed again in the form of the
KL divergence or the Wasserstein $W_2$ distance. The computed divergence (_trust
region regression loss_) is then added to the policy gradient loss function with
a high factor.

We explore PG-TRL as an alternative training method to PPO.

## Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)

Usually, reinforcement learning environments are modeled as POMDPs. POMDPs only
have a single agent interacting with the environment, so for multi-agent
settings, we need a different system that can model multiple agents interacting
with the world. There are different ways of extending POMDPs to work for
multi-agent tasks. Decentralized POMDPs (Dec-POMDP)
[@{https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783319289274}] are a generalization of
POMDPs that split the action and observation spaces into those of each agent.

A Dec-POMDP consists of:

- A set of $n$ agents $D=\{1,\dots,n\}$
- A set of states $S$
- A set of joint actions $A$
- A set of transition probabilities between states $T(s,a,s') = P(s'|s,a)$
- A set of joint observations $O$
- An immediate reward function $R: S Ã A â \mathbb{R}$

Note that this definition is very similar to a normal POMDP. The difference is
that the set of joint observations and joint actions consists of a tuple of the
observations/actions of each individual agent (i.e.
$a\in A = \langle a_1,\dots,a_n \rangle$, where $a_i$ is the action of agent
$i$).

In Dec-POMDPs every agent can have differing observations and actions. The
subset of Dec-POMDPs where the agents are homogenous has been described as a
SwarMDP by @{https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/3091125.3091320}. The joint
observation and action spaces thus become $O = \hat{O^n}$ and $A = \hat{A^n}$,
where $\hat{O}$ and $\hat{A}$ are the observation and action space of each
agent.

## Environment model and learning process

In our experiments, we impose a set of restrictions on the environments and
learning process. The restrictions we impose are mostly based on [@maxpaper]. A
more detailed description of these restrictions, as well as related work using
other variants is given in in @sec:relatedwork.

In general, the agents in a multi-agent environment can differ in their
intrinsic properties. For example, they can have different control dynamics,
maximum speeds, different observation systems, or different possible actions. We
only consider environments with homogenous agents: All agents have the same
physical properties, observation space, and action space. They only differ in
their extrinsic properties, e.g., their current position, rotation, and speed.
This also causes them to have a different perspective, different observations
and thus different actions, resulting in differing behavior even when they are
acting according to the same policy. We thus only consider environments where
the agents are homogenous â each agent has the same possible observations and
actions.

We only consider cooperative environments, and we use the same reward function
for all agents. Real-world multi-agent tasks are usually cooperative since in
adversarial environments, where different agents have different goals, one
entity would not have control over multiple adversarial parties.

We focus on global visibility since the additional noise introduced by local
observability would be detrimental to the quality of our results.

For training, we use the centralized-learning/decentralized-execution (CLDE)
approach â a shared common policy is learned for all agents, but the policy is
executed by each agent separately.

PPO and other policy gradient methods are designed for single-agent
environments. We adapt PPO to the multi-agent setting without making any major
changes: The policy parameters are shared for all agents, and each agent gets
the same global reward. The value function for advantage estimation is based on
the same architecture as the policy. Since the stable-baselines3 implementation
of PPO is already written for vectorized environments (collecting trajectories
from many environments running in parallel), we create a new VecEnv
implementation that flattens multiple agents in multiple environments.

Similarly to the setup used for TRPO by @maxpaper, we collect the data of each
agent as if that agent was the only agent in the world. For example, a batch of
a single step of 10 agents each in 20 different environment becomes 200 separate
training samples. Each agent still only has access to its own local
observations, not the global system state. This means that during inference
time, each agent has to act independently, based on the observations it makes
locally, but is rewarded with the same reward each agent receives. This common
reward reflects the cooperative structure of the task.

## Aggregation methods

The observations of each agent in an MARL task contains a varying number of
observables. The observables can be clustered into groups where each observable
is of the same kind and shape. For example, one observable group would contain
all the neighboring agents, while another would contain, e.g., a specific type
of other observed objects in the world.

To apply actor-critic training methods, both our policy to predict the actions
and the critic to estimate the value function are trainable neural networks. We
need a method to aggregate the observations in one observable group into a
format that can be used as the input of these neural networks. Specifically,
this means that the output of the aggregation method needs to have a fixed
dimensionality. In the following, we present different aggregation methods and
their properties, including related work that uses those aggregation methods.

### Concatenation

The simplest aggregation method is concatenation, where each observable is
concatenated along the feature dimension into a single observation vector. This
method has a few issues however: We can have a varying number of observables,
but since the input size of the neural policy network is fixed, we need to set a
maximum number of observables, and set the input dimensionality of the policy
architecture proportional to that maximum. Concatenation also ignores the other
useful properties of the observables, namely the uniformity (the feature at
index $i$ of one observable has the same meaning as the feature at index $i$ of
every other observable in a group) and the exchangeability (the order of the
observables is either meaningless or variable). For concatenation, we have to
choose an ordering of the observables. This ordering is either stable but
meaningless (since the observables are by definition permutation-invariant), or
meaningful but unstable (ordering by an extrinsic property, for example ordering
by distance to the current agent).

Concatenation scales poorly with a large number of observables since the input
size of the neural network has to scale proportionally to the maximum number of
observables. It is used for example by @mpe to aggregate the neighboring agents'
observations and actions.

### Mean aggregation

Instead of concatenating each element $o_i$ in an observable group $O$, we can
also interpret each element as a sample of a distribution that describes the
current system state. We use the empirical mean of the samples to retrieve a
representation of the system state $Ï_O$ based on all observed observables, as
shown in @eq:meanagg.

$$Ï_O = Î¼_O = \frac{1}{|O|} \sum_{o_i â O} o_i$$ {#eq:meanagg}

@maxpaper used mean aggregation for deep multi-agent reinforcement learning and
compared it to other aggregation methods. @gregor applied mean aggregation to
more complex tasks in more realistic simulated environments.

Mean aggregation is strongly related to mean field theory. Mean field theory is
a general principle of modeling the effect that many particles have by averaging
them into a single field, ignoring the individual variances of each particle.
The application of mean field theory for multi-agent systems were formally
defined by @{https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11537-007-0657-8} as
_Mean Field Games_. In MARL, mean field Q-learning and mean field actor-critic
was defined and evaluated by @{http://proceedings.mlr.press/v80/yang18d.html}.
@meanfielduav use mean fields productively for control of numerous unmanned
aerial vehicles.

[@meanfielduav]: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9137257

### Aggregation with other pooling functions

Instead of using the empirical mean, other aggregation methods can also be used:

Max pooling:

$$Ï_O = \max_{o_i â O} o_i$$

Softmax pooling:

$$Ï_O = \sum_{o_i â O} o_i \frac{e^{o_i}}{\sum_{o_j â O} e^{o_j}}$$

Max-pooling is widely used in convolutional neural networks to reduce the
feature map dimensionality, and it was used as an alternative to mean pooling in
MARL by [@gregor]. Softmax aggregation was used by
@{https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.04908} for MARL.

### Bayesian aggregation {#sec:bayesianagg1}

Aggregation with Gaussian conditioning works by starting from a Gaussian prior
distribution and updating it using a probabilistic observation model for every
seen observation. Gaussian conditioning is widely used in applications such as
Gaussian process regression
[@{https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-28650-9_4}].

We consider Bayesian aggregation as defined by [@bayesiancontextaggregation, sec
7.1]. We introduce $z$ as a random variable with a Gaussian distribution:

$$z \sim \mathcal{N}(Î¼_z,Ï_z^2)\quad (p(z) â¡ \mathcal{N}(Î¼_z,Ï_z^2))$$

Initially, this random variable is estimated using a diagonal Gaussian prior as
an a-priori estimate:

$$p_0(z)â¡\mathcal{N}(Î¼_{z_0}, diag(Ï_{z_0}^2))$$

This prior is then updated with Bayesian conditioning using each of the observed
elements $r_i$. We interpret each observation as a new sample from the
distribution $p(z)$, each with a mean $r_i$ and a standard deviation $Ï_{r_i}$.
We use the probabilistic observation model and consider the conditional
probability $$p(r_i|z) â¡ \mathcal{N}(r_n|z, Ï_{r_i}^2).$$

With standard Gaussian conditioning
[@{https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9780387310732}] this leads to the closed
form factorized posterior description of $z$:

$$\sigma_z^2 = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{\sigma_{z_0}^2} + \sum_{i=1}^n{\frac{1}{\sigma_{r_i}^2}}}$$

$$\mu_z = \mu_{z_0} + \sigma_z^2 \cdot \sum_{i=1}^{n}{\frac{(r_i-\mu_{z_0})}{\sigma_{r_i}^2}}$$

Bayesian aggregation was used by @bayesiancontextaggregation for context
aggregation in conditional latent variable (CLV) models. There is no related
work using Bayesian aggregation for MARL.

### Attention mechanisms {#sec:mha}

Attention mechanisms are commonly used in other areas of machine learning.

An attention function computes some compatibility between a _query_ $Q$ and a
_key_ $K$, and uses this compatibility as the weight to compute a weighted sum
of the _values_ $V$. The query, key, and value are all vectors.

[@att]:
  https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2017/hash/3f5ee243547dee91fbd053c1c4a845aa-Abstract.html

<!-- For attentive aggregation, the observations from the different agents are first
attended to by some attention mechanism, then the resulting new feature vector
is aggregated using some aggregation mechanism. -->

<!-- {attention: 30,31,32,33 (from ARE paper)} -->

The multi-head attention mechanism was introduced by @att and is the core of the
state-of-the-art model for many natural language processing tasks.

We only consider the specific multi-head residual masked self attention variant
of attention mechanisms for observation aggregation used by @openai.

There, the attention function in is a scaled dot-product attention as described
by [@att]:

$$\text{Attention}(Q,K,V) = \text{softmax}(\frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}})V$$

$d_k$ is the dimensionality of the key $K$.

Instead of using only a single attention function, [@att] uses multiple
independent attention heads. The inputs ($Q, K, V$) of each of the heads
$1,\dots,n$ as well as the concatenated output is transformed with separately
learned dense layers (described as weight matrices $W_i^Q, W_i^K, W_i^V, W^O$).
The full multi-head attention module $\text{MHA}()$ thus looks like this:

$$\text{head}_i = \text{Attention}(QW_i^Q,KW_i^K,VW_i^V)$$

$$\text{MHA}(Q,K,V)=\text{concat}(\text{head}_1,\dots,\text{head}_n)W^O$$

For self-attention, the query $Q$, the key $K$ and the value $V$ are all set to
the same input value. In [@openai], the authors combine the multi-head attention
with a mean aggregation. Note that they only use the attention mechanism to
individually transform the information from each separate observable into a new
feature set instead of directly using it as a weighing function for the
aggregation.

@{http://proceedings.mlr.press/v97/iqbal19a.html} use a different approach with
a decentralized policy and a centralized critic. An attention mechanism is used
to weigh the features from the other agents, then aggregates them to calculate
the value function.

@are first encode all aggregatable observations together with the proprioceptive
observations with an "extrinsic encoder", then compute attention weights using
another encoder from that and aggregate the features retrieved from a separate
"intrinsic encoder" using those weights.

### Other aggregation methods

@maxpaper also did experiments with aggregation into histograms and aggregation
with radial basis functions, though the results indicated they were outperformed
by a neural network encoder with mean aggregation.

systems. In this chapter, we describe some related work in MARL, including
variations in the training process and the environments.

## Centralized vs decentralized learning

During training, the agent policies can either be learned in a centralized or a
decentralized fashion.

In decentralized learning, each agent learns their own policy, while in
centralized learning, the policy is shared between all agents. Decentralized
learning has the advantage that the agents do not need to be homogenous, since
the learned policy can be completely different. It also means that it's harder
for the agents to learn to collaborate though, since they are not intrinsically
similar to each other. Decentralized learning is used in
[@{https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.00877};
@{https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6415291};
@{http://proceedings.mlr.press/v80/zhang18n.html}].

Centralized learning means the training process happens centralized, with a
single policy. It has the advantage of only needing to train one policy network
and the possibility of being more sample-efficient. Centralized learning
requires homogenous agents since the policy network parameters are shared across
all agents. It is used for example in [@{https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.08926};
@{https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-71682-4_5}].

## Centralized vs decentralized execution

When using centralized learning, it is possible to use a single policy to output
actions for all agents at the same time. This is called "centralized execution".
The policy chooses the actions based on the global system state in a "birds-eye"
view of the world. The disadvantage is that this means agents can't act
independently if the environment has restrictions such as partial observability,
and it is less robust to communication failures and to agent "deaths".

The alternative is decentralized execution â the observation inputs and action
outputs of the policy networks are local to a single agent. This can formally be
described as a _Decentralized Partially Observable Markov Decision Process_
(Dec-POMDP) [@{https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-27645-3_15}].
Decentralized learning with decentralized execution is needed for heterogenous
agents (e.g. [@{http://proceedings.mlr.press/v80/zhang18n.html};
@{https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6415291}]). When combining centralized
learning with decentralized execution, there is only one policy network that is
shared between all agents but the inputs and outputs of the policy are separate.

Centralized-learning with decentralized-execution is thus a compromise between
performance, robustness, and sample efficiency. CLDE is used e.g. by [@mpe;
@maxpaper; @{https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-71682-4_5};
@{https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.08926};
@{https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2016/hash/c7635bfd99248a2cdef8249ef7bfbef4-Abstract.html}].

## Cooperative, adversarial, team-based

Multi-agent environments can be cooperative, adversarial, or team-based.
Cooperative environments are those where all the agents have one common goal. In
adversarial tasks each agent has their own independent goal that conflicts with
the goal of the other agents. An example for a cooperative environment is the
rendezvous task: All agents need to meet up at a single point, where the agents
have to decide independently on the location. The reward here is the negative
average pairwise distance of the agents, see [@sec:rendezvous]. Note that
cooperative environments can also include other adversarial agents, as long as
those agents are controlled by an explicit algorithm and not a learned policy.
From the perspective of the policy, these agents are considered part of the
environment.

Cooperative learning can be done with separate agent rewards or a single common
reward. Cooperative learning with a single reward means the reward must be
somewhat sparse, since each agent cannot easily judge what the impact of its own
actions were on the reward in any given time step. This also makes it impossible
for an agent to gain an egoistic advantage over the other agents, enforcing the
learned policy to become Pareto optimal. Another approach was introduced by
@{https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4399095}, who create a compromise between
the sample-efficiency of individual rewards and the Pareto-optimality of a
common reward for cooperative MARL settings with their _Hysteretic Q-Learning_
algorithm that jointly optimizes an individual as well as a common reward.

Adversarial environments are usually zero-sum, that is the average reward over
all agents is zero. An example for an adversarial environment is the _Gather_
task described by @{https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/11371}: In
a world with limited food, agents need to gather food to survive. They can also
kill each other to reduce the scarcity of the food. Another example of an
adversarial task is Go [@{https://www.nature.com/articles/nature24270}] as well
as many other board games, though these usually have a fairly small number of
agents.

Team-based tasks have multiple teams that each have a conflicting goal, but from
the perspective of each team the task is cooperative (with a single reward
function). The team reward can either be defined directly for the team or by
averaging a reward function of each team member.

<!-- One example of a team-based environment is [@{https://openai.com/blog/openai-five/}]. -->

An example of a team-based environment is the OpenAI Hide-and-Seek Task
[@openai]. In this task, there are two teams of agents in a simulated physical
world with obstacles, and members of one team try to find the members of the
other team. The Hide-team is rewarded +1 if none of the team members is seen by
any seeker, and -1 otherwise. The Seek-team is given the opposite reward.

## Partial visibility

The observations that each agent receives in our experiments are local. For
example, if one agent sees another, that agent's properties are observed
relative to the current agent â the distance, relative bearing, and relative
speed.

In addition, each agent may only have local visibility, for example it can only
observe the positions of agents and objects in the world within some radius or
the visibility can be hindered by obstacles. In [@maxpaper] both the local and
global visibility variants of the same tasks were considered.

## Simultaneous vs turn-based

In general, multi-agent environments can be turn-based or simultaneous. In
turn-based environments each agent acts in sequence, with the world state
changing after each turn. In simultaneous environments, all agents act "at the
same time", i.e. the environment only changes after all agents have acted in one
time step.

Simultaneous environments can be considered a subset of turn-based environments,
since a simultaneous environment can be converted to a turn-based one by fixing
the environment during turns and only applying the actions of each agent after
the time step is finished. For this reason the API of PettingZoo [@pettingzoo]
is based around turn-based environments. Examples of turn-based environments
include most board games and many video games. Most real world scenarios are
simultaneous though, so we only consider environments with simultaneous actions.

## MARL tasks in related work

@openai create a team-based multi-agent environment with one team of agents
trying to find and "catch" the agents of the other team.
@{https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.12808} create a generic physics-based world and a
system to automatically generate cooperative and adversarial tasks like _Hide
and Seek_ and _Capture the Flag_ within this world, then train agents to be able
to solve multiple tasks in this world. They then show their agents generalize to
be able to solve unseen tasks.

@are test their attention-based architecture on three environments: (1) A
catching game in a discrete 2D world, where multiple paddles moving in one
dimension try to catch multiple balls that fall down the top of the screen. (2)
A spreading game, where N agents try to cover N landmarks. The world is
continuous, but the action space is discrete. This game is similar to the
spreading game defined in [@mpe]. (3) StarCraft micromanagement: Two groups of
units in the StarCraft game battle each other, each unit controlled by an agent.

these tasks.

@gregor define a set of environments based on Kilobots, simple small round
robots in a virtual environment together with boxes. The Kilobots are tasked
with moving the boxes around or arranging them based on their color. We compare

# Scalable information aggregation for deep MARL policies {#sec:contribution}

We introduce a policy architecture for deep multi-agent reinforcement learning
that projects observations from one or more different kinds of observables into
samples of latent spaces, then aggregates them into a single latent value. This
makes the architecture scale to any number as well as a varying number of
observables. We use the same encode-aggregate-concatenate structure as
[@maxpaper] and a similar method of attentive aggregation as [@openai].

## Policy Architecture

While the policy architecture and weights are shared for all agents, the inputs
are dependent on the current agent $a_k$, thus leading to different outputs for
the action and value function for each agent.

Depending on the task, the inputs differ. In general, we always have the
proprioceptive observations (how the agent $a_k$ sees itself), and the
observations from the $n$ neighboring agents $a_1,â¦,a_n$. The observations from
each neighbor have the same shape, but differ from the self-observations since
they can include other information like the distance between $a_k$ and $a_i$,
and they may be missing some information that may not be known to $a_k$. In
addition, there can be additional sets of observations, for example for objects
or scripted agents in the environment. The architecture can handle any amount of
observation sets.

Since we aggregate each set of observables of the same kind and shape into one
aggregate, we call each of the sets of observations an "aggregation group" $G$:

$$G = \{ g_1, \dots, g_n \}$$

$G$ is a single aggregation group with each of the $n$ aggregatables in the
group called $g_i$. There can also be multiple aggregation groups that we call
($G^{(a)}, G^{(b)}$), each with their own number of observables. Since the $g_i$
are later aggregated with a permutation-invariant aggregation function, their
order does not matter.

First, we collect the observations for each instance $1<i<n$ of each aggregation
group $G$. These observations can be relative to the current agent. Each
observation in the aggregation group $G$ is thus a function of the agent $a_k$
and the instance $g_i$. We call this observation $o_{kâg_i}$, since agent $k$ is
observing the $i$th observable in group $G$:

$$o_{kâg_i} = \text{observe}(a_k, g_i)$$

After collecting the observations for aggregation group $g$, the observations
are each encoded separately into a latent embedding space:

$$e_{kâg_i} = \text{enc}(o_{kâg_i})$$

In general, the encoder $\text{enc}()$ could be an arbitrary differentiable
function that maps the observation into a latent space. In our case,
$\text{enc}()$ is a dense neural network with zero or more hidden layers, with
shared weights across the observables in an observable group.

After being encoded, we interpret each instance of an aggregation group as one
sample of a latent space that represents some form of the information of the
aggregation group that is relevant to the agent. These samples are then
aggregated using one of the aggregation methods described below to get a single
latent space value for each aggregation group:

$$e_{kâG} = \text{agg}_{i=0}^n(e_{kâg_i})$$

We then concatenate all the latent spaces as well as the proprioceptive
observations $p_k$ of the agent $k$ to get a single encoded value $e_k$:

$$e_k = (p_k || e_{kâG^{(a)}} || e_{kâG^{(b)}} || ...)$$

This value is then passed through a decoder that consists of one or more dense
layers. Finally, the decoded value is transformed to the dimensionality of the
action space or to $1$ to get the output of the value function. While we share
the architecture for the policy and value function, we use a separate copy of
the compute graph for the value function, so the weights and training are
completely independent.

@Fig:model shows a schematic of the general model architecture described above.

![A schematic of our general model architecture for deep MARL policies with scalable information aggregation. The observation inputs consist of the agent itself and multiple aggregatable observation groups. The observations from the aggregation groups are each passed through an encoder and aggregated with an aggregator. Afterwards all the aggregated observations are concatenated and decoded to get the policy and value function.](images/model.drawio.svg){#fig:model}

The tasks we consider have a continuous action space. We use a diagonalized
Gaussian distribution where the mean $Î¼$ of each action is output by the neural
network while the variance of each action is a free-standing learnable variable
only passed through $\exp$ or $\text{softplus}$ to ensure positivity.

## Mean/Max/Softmax Aggregation

Each sample in the latent space is weighted by a function $\text{weigh}()$ and
aggregated using an aggregation operator $\bigoplus$:

$$e_{kâG} = \bigoplus_{i=1}^n \text{weigh}(e_{kâg_i})$$

For mean aggregation, the weighing function multiplies by $\frac{1}{n}$ and the
aggregation operator is the sum:

$$e_{kâG} = \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{1}{n} \cdot (e_{kâg_i})$$

For max aggregation, the weight is $1$ and the aggregation operator takes the
largest value:

$$e_{kâG} = \max_{i=1}^n e_{kâg_i}$$

For softmax aggregation, the weight is based on the softmax function and the
aggregation operator is the sum:

$$e_{kâG} = \sum_{i=1}^n \left(\frac{\exp(e_{kâg_i})}{\sum_{j=1}^n \exp(e_{kâg_j})}\right) e_{kâg_i}$$

## Bayesian Aggregation {#sec:bayesianagg}

We use a separate latent space and thus a separate observation model $p(z)$ for
each aggregation group.

To make the Bayesian aggregation as described in [@sec:bayesianagg1] work in our
policy network, we need an estimation describing the Gaussian prior ($Î¼_{z_0}$
and $Ï_{z_0}^2$) as well as the observed means $r_i$ and variances $Ï_{r_i}^2$.

The mean and variance of the Gaussian prior are learned as free-standing
variables using the backpropagation during training, independent of the inputs
of the neural network. The prior variance as well as the variance of the
observations are rectified to enforce positivity using $\text{softplus}$.

To get the observed elements $r_i$, we use the two encoder networks $enc_r$ and
$enc_Ï$ that consist of a set of dense layers:

$$r_i = \text{enc}_r(o_{kâg_i}), \quad Ï_{r_i} = \text{enc}_Ï(o_{kâg_i})$$

$\text{enc}_r$ and $\text{enc}_Ï$ are either separate dense neural networks or a
single dense neural network with the output having two scalars per feature (one
for the mean, one for the variance). Finally, we retrieve the value of $e_{kâG}$
from the aggregated latent variable, using either just the mean of $z$:

$$e_{kâG} = Î¼_z$$

or by concatenating the mean and the variance:

$$e_{kâG} = (Î¼_z, Ï_z^2).$$

The mean and variance are calculated from the conditioned Gaussian based on the
encoded observations as described in [@sec:bayesianagg1]:

$$\sigma_z^2 = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{\sigma_{z_0}^2} + \sum_{i=1}^n{\frac{1}{\text{enc}_Ï(o_{kâg_i})^2}}}$$

$$\mu_z = \mu_{z_0} + \sigma_z^2 \cdot \sum_{i=1}^{n}{\frac{(\text{enc}_r(o_{kâg_i})-\mu_{z_0})}{\text{enc}_Ï(o_{kâg_i})^2}}$$

A graphical overview of this method is shown in [@fig:bayesianagg].

![Bayesian Aggregation in graphical form. The observations from the neighboring agents are encoded with the value encoder and the confidence encoder. They are then used to condition the Gaussian prior estimate of the latent variable $z$ to get the final mean and variance of the a-posteriori estimate. The mean and optionally the variance estimate of $z$ are concatenated with the latent spaces from the other aggregatables and passed to the decoder as shown in @fig:model.](images/bayesianagg.drawio.svg){#fig:bayesianagg}

## Attentive Aggregation

When using residual self-attentive aggregation, we define the aggregated feature
as

$$e_{kâg} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n \text{resatt}(\text{enc}(o_i))$$

with $\text{enc}$ being a dense neural network with zero or more hidden layers,
and

$$\text{resatt}(o_i) = o_i + \text{dense}(\text{MHA}(o_i, o_i, o_i)).$$

_Residual_ means that the input is added to the output of the attention
mechanism, so the attention mechanism only has to learn a _residual_ value that
modifies the input features.

The $\text{MHA}()$ module is the multi-head attention module from
[@{https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2017/hash/3f5ee243547dee91fbd053c1c4a845aa-Abstract.html},
sec. 3.2.2] as described in @sec:mha.

This method of attentive aggregation is similar to the method successfully used
by @openai. An overview over the model architecture used in [@openai] can be
seen in [@fig:openai].

![A schematic of the model architecture used by OpenAI [@openai] using masked residual self-attention. It is similar to our architecture ([@fig:model]) except for the LIDAR in the self-observations as well as the LSTM layer at the end.](images/model-openai.drawio.svg){#fig:openai}


# Experiments {#sec:experiments}

## Experimental setup

All of our experiments were run using stable-baselines3 (sb3)
[@{https://github.com/DLR-RM/stable-baselines3}]. _OpenAI Baselines_ is a deep
reinforcement learning framework that provides implementations of various
reinforcement learning algorithms for TensorFlow. Stable-baselines is an
extension of the original code base with better documentation and more
flexibility for custom architectures and environments. Sb3 is the continuation
of the stable-baselines project, rewritten using PyTorch. We rely on sb3 since
the performance of PPO is known to depend on a number of implementation details
[@{https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1etN1rtPB}] and the sb3 implementation of
PPO-Clip has been shown to perform as well as the original OpenAI implementation
[@{https://stable-baselines3.readthedocs.io/en/master/modules/ppo.html#results}].

We extended sb3 for the multi-agent use case by adapting the vectorized
environment implementation to support multiple agents in a single environment,
as well as adapting the training and evaluation functionality to correctly
handle the centralized-learning decentralized-execution method. We also
implement Trust Region Layers [@trl] as a new training algorithm for sb3 in
order to be able to directly compare PPO and TRL. When mentioned in the results
section, we optimized the hyperparameters using Optuna
[@{https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3292500.3330701}]. A more detailed list of
batch sizes and other relevant settings can be found in @sec:appendixhyper.

<!-- {describe batch size, other meta settings} -->

## Considered tasks

To evaluate the different aggregation methods we need simulated environments
where multiple agents can cooperatively solve a task. Since most of the commonly
used tasks used to benchmark reinforcement learning algorithms are designed for
a single agent, we use custom-built environments.

The following shows which specific tasks we consider. We start with a simple
task and continue with progressively harder tasks that have more complex
information in the environment that the policy needs to process.

### Rendezvous task {#sec:rendezvous}

In the rendezvous task, a set of $n$ agents try to meet up in a single point. An
example is shown in @fig:rendezvous1. Our implementation of the rendezvous task
is modeled after [@maxpaper].

![Visualization of one successful episode of the rendezvous task (from [@maxpaper])](images/rendezvous1.png){#fig:rendezvous1}

The agents are modeled as infinitesimal dots without collisions. They use
double-integrator unicycle dynamics
[@{https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/976029}], so the action outputs are the
acceleration of the linear velocity ($\dot{v}$) and the angular velocity
($\dot{Ï}$). The agents move around in a square world that either has walls at
the edge or is on a torus (the position is calculated modulo $100$).

The observation space of agent $a_i$ comprises the following information:

1.  The own linear velocity $v_{a_i}$
2.  The own angular velocity $Ï_{a_i}$
3.  The ratio of currently visible agents
4.  If the observation space is not a torus: the distance and angle to the
    nearest wall
5.  For each neighboring agent:
    1.  The distance between the current agent and the neighbor
    2.  The cos and sin of the relative bearing (the angle between the direction
        the agent is going and the position of the neighbor)
    3.  The cos and sin of the neighbor's bearing to us
    4.  The velocity of the neighbor relative to the agent's velocity
    5.  The ratio of currently visible agents for the neighbor

The reward that every agent gets is the mean of all the pairwise agent
distances:

$$r = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=0}^n \sum_{j=i+1}^n ||p_i-p_j||$$

The episode ends after 1024 time steps.

### Single-Evader Pursuit task

In the pursuit task, multiple pursuers try to catch an evader. The evader agent
has a higher speed than the pursuers, so the pursuers need to cooperate to be
able to catch it. The world is a two-dimensional torus (the position $(x, y)$
are floating point numbers modulo 100). If the world was infinite, the evader
could run away in one direction forever, and if it had walls, the pursuers could
easily corner the evader. The pursuit tasks are modeled after [@maxpaper]. An
example episode of the pursuit task is in [@fig:pursuit1].

![Visualization of one successful episode of the pursuit task (from [@maxpaper]). The pursuers are in blue, the evader is in red.](images/pursuit1.png){#fig:pursuit1}

The agents are modeled with single-integrator unicycle dynamics. The action
outputs are the linear velocity ($v$) and the angular velocity ($Ï$).

The evader is not part of the training and uses a hard-coded algorithm based on
maximizing Voronoi-regions as described by
@{https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0005109816301911}. It
is thus part of the environment and not an "agent" as seen from the perspective
of the training algorithm.

The observation space for the single-evader pursuit task comprises the following
information:

1. The ratio of agents that are visible
2. For each neighboring agent:
   1. The distance between the current agent and the neighbor
   2. The cos and sin of the relative bearing (the angle between the direction
      the agent is going and the position of the neighbor)
   3. The cos and sin of the neighbor's bearing to us
3. For the evader:
   1. The distance between the current agent and the evader
   2. The cos and sin of the relative bearing

The reward function of all the agents is the minimum distance of any agent to
the evader:

$$r = min_{i=0}^n ||p_{a_i} - p_{e}||$$

The episode ends once the evader is caught or 1024 time steps have passed. The
evader is declared as caught if the distance is minimum distance between an
agent and the evader is less than $1\%$ of the world width.

The observation of the evader is handled as a single observable in a second
aggregation group to be able to scale the policy architecture to multiple
evaders without modifications.

### Multi-evader pursuit

The multi-evader pursuit task is the same as the normal pursuit task, except
there are multiple hard-coded evaders.

The reward here is different, since defining the reward as for the single-evader
task is not obvious. The reward is +1 whenever an evader is caught, 0 otherwise.
An evader is declared caught if the distance to the nearest pursuer is less than
$\frac{2}{100}$ of the world width. Contrary to the single-evader task, the
episode does not end when an evader is caught and instead always runs for 1024
timesteps.

### Box assembly task

In the box assembly task, the agents are modeled similar to Kilobots, as
described by @gregor. The agents are two-dimensional circles with collision.

For simplicity, we again use single-integrator unicycle dynamics with the linear
velocity $v$ and the angular velocity $Ï$ as the action outputs instead of the
specific dynamics of real Kilobots.

The world is a square and contains a few two-dimensional boxes (squares) as
obstacles. For the box assembly task, the goal is to get all the boxes as close
together as possible. Since the agents are much smaller than the boxes, moving a
box is hard for a single agent. The reward is the derivation of the negative sum
of the pairwise distances between the boxes. We run this task with four boxes
and 10 agents.

An example of a successful episode of the task is in @fig:assembly.

![Example successful episode of the box assembly task (from [@gregor])](images/box-assembly.png){#fig:assembly}

[@gregor]:
  https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Using-M-Embeddings-to-Learn-Control-Strategies-for-Gebhardt-H%C3%BCttenrauch/9f550815f8858e7c4c8aef23665fa5817884f1b3

The observation space for the box assembly task contains the following
information:

1. The absolute position $(x, y)$ of the current agent
2. The sin, cos of the absolute rotation of the current agent
3. For every neighboring agent:
   1. The distance between the current agent and the neighbor
   2. The sin and cos of the bearing angle to the neighbor
   3. The sin and cos of the neighbor's rotation relative to our rotation
4. For every neighboring box:
   1. The distance between the current agent and the box
   2. The sin and cos of the bearing angle to the box
   3. The sin and cos of the box's rotation relative to our rotation

### Box clustering task

The task setup for box clustering is the same as for the box assembly task,
except that each box is assigned a color. The goal is to move the boxes into an
arrangement such that boxes of the same color are as close together as possible,
while boxes of different colors are far away. Each color of box has an explicit
target in one corner of the world. The reward is calculated by taking the sum of
negative distances between each box and its cluster target, then taking the
difference of this after the step and before the step.

The observation space is the same as the observation space of the box assembly
task, except that each cluster of objects is aggregated into a separate
aggregation space, and that there is an additional one-hot encoded cluster ID in
the object observation space. @Fig:clustering2 shows an example successful
episode of the clustering task with two four boxes split into two clusters.

# Results {#sec:results}

In this section, we present the results of our experiments. We compare (1) the
training performance of the different aggregation methods on various tasks, (2)
aggregating different observation sets into a single vs multiple latent spaces
(3) various variants of Bayesian aggregation, and (4) the training algorithms
PPO and TRL.

In order to compare the performance of different variants, we consider the
average reward per episode over the agent steps used during training. This way
we can evaluate and compare the overall best results as well as the sample
efficiency.

Each policy gradient training step consists of multiple gradient descent steps
with a set of batches of trajectory rollouts generated using the previous
policy. We evaluate the performance after each training step on a separate set
of evaluation environments.

Unless mentioned otherwise, the following setup is used:

- The result plots show the median reward of the n runs at a specific training
  step, the error band is the 25th and 75th percentile of runs
- The activation function used after each layer is LeakyReLU
- For the Bayesian aggregation:
  - We only use the mean value $Î¼_z$ as an output, not $Î¼_z$ and $Ï_z^2$
  - We use a single shared encoder for the value and confidence estimates
  - The a-priori estimate $Î¼_{z_0}$ is learnable separately for each feature
    dimension
  - The variance of the a-priori estimate as well as the encoded estimates are
    rectified using $\text{softplus}$.
- Multiple aggregatable groups are aggregated into separate latent spaces
- The parameters of the policy and value function are not shared
- The training algorithm used is PPO

Due to time and resource constraints, we only use individually hyper-parameter
optimized architectures on the multi-evader pursuit and rendezvous tasks, and
use the same architecture for all aggregation methods on the other tasks.

## Aggregation method results

We compare the performance of the different aggregation methods (Bayesian
aggregation, mean aggregation, attentive aggregation) on multiple tasks.

We use the notation `64-agg-64` to describe the layer sizes of the neural
network: The numbers before `agg` are the sequential layer sizes of the dense
layers of the encoders of each aggregation group. The numbers after `agg` are
the layer sizes in the decoder after the concatenation of the proprioceptive
observations with the aggregated observations (compare @fig:model).

We start with a very simple task (rendezvous), then look at progressively more
difficult tasks with more complex information that needs to be aggregated.

### Rendezvous task

The rendezvous task is very simple and thus gives a good baseline to show
whether our model works in general. It only has one simple aggregation group
(the agents).

@Fig:resrendezvous shows a comparison between mean and Bayesian aggregation on
the rendezvous task with twenty agents in a two-dimensional square world with
walls. The medium architecture is the one optimized on the pursuit task
(`120-60-agg-160`). The simple architecture is the one used in [@maxpaper]
(`64-agg-64`). The optimized architecture was optimized on the rendezvous task
with Bayesian aggregation directly: `146-120-agg-19-177-162`. All architectures
and aggregation methods successfully solve the task. The aggregation method does
not make any difference in the performance, but both the simple and the medium
architecture have a "drop" in training speed at around 2 million steps, while
the optimized architecture smoothly learns the problem. The logarithmic scale
graph to the right shows that while the simple and optimized architecture both
reach the same final score, the medium architecture never reaches the same
score. This might be because both the simple and the optimized architecture have
a bottleneck layer after the aggregation, forcing the neural network to simplify
the strategy.

We show a random exemplary episode of each a policy with median performance for
the medium and optimized architectures in @fig:rendezvouseg. For the medium
architecture case with the Bayesian aggregation, we notice that the consensus
location does not stay the same and instead drifts even after all agents are at
the same spot. In addition, sometimes there is one or more stragglers that take
significantly longer to get to the consensus location. For the medium
architecture with the mean aggregation, the agents do not converge on a single
point, but instead continue to circle a small area. For the optimized
architecture, the consensus is reached quickly (after 100 of 1000 time steps)
and stays at the same spot.

![Results on the rendezvous task. _Opt_ is the hyper-parameter optimized architecture. The results barely differ between the mean and Bayesian aggregation, but the size of the policy architecture makes a difference. In the logarithmic view on the right it can be seen that the medium architecture does not reach the same final performance as the other two architectures.](images/plots/2021-07-22_15.51.34-Rendezvous.svg){#fig:resrendezvous}

### Single-evader pursuit task

The pursuit task is a slightly more complex task with the single evader being in
a second aggregation group with one observable. The results here show that the
learned policies can handle a moving object in the world and that the
architecture works with multiple observation groups.

@Fig:ressp shows the results on the single-evader pursuit task with 10 pursuers
and one evader. The neural network architecture is fixed at `120-60-agg-160` for
all methods. All methods learn the task quickly with the same best performance,
with the mean aggregation achieving the maximum performance slightly faster.
This shows that the task is simpler than the multi-evader pursuit task, even
though the policy architecture is the same. This is both due to the fact that
there are fewer evaders and that the reward is more sparse (minimum-distance for
single-evader vs count-catches for multi-evader).

![Results on Single Pursuit task. The performance is similar for all methods, with the mean aggregation achieving the best performance slightly faster.](images/plots/2021-07-14_13.55.20-Single-evader
Pursuit.svg){#fig:ressp}

### Multi-evader pursuit task

The multi-evader pursuit task adds complexity by having multiple evaders that
need to be caught. In addition, the reward is sparser due to the fact that each
catch only gives a binary reward signal. The results here show whether our
policy is able to process multiple aggregation groups with multiple moving
entities. Here, we consider the multi-evader pursuit task with 50 pursuers and 5
evaders on a torus. @Fig:resmpsmall shows the results of the multi-evader
pursuit task with different aggregation methods with the same architecture used
in [@maxpaper] to be able to directly compare the results. The architecture is
64-agg-64 with the tanh activation function. With this architecture, the
Bayesian aggregation performs best.

![Results on the multi-evader pursuit task with the NN architecture adapted from
[@maxpaper]. The Bayesian aggregation performs
best.](images/plots/2021-07-10_13.30.06-Multi-Evader Pursuit
(smallarch).svg){#fig:resmpsmall}

@Fig:resmpopt shows the results with neural network architectures that were
separately hyper-parameter optimized for each aggregation method except max
aggregation. The optimized architecture for the mean aggregation is
`174-226-97-agg-96`, the same architecture is used for the max aggregation. The
optimized architecture for the Bayesian aggregation is `120-60-agg-160`. The
optimized architecture for the attentive aggregation is `72-agg-132-200`. All
optimized architectures use the LeakyReLU activation functions. Note that the
architecture optimized on the mean aggregation is the deepest with three hidden
layers before the aggregation, while the optimized architecture on the attentive
aggregation has multiple layers after the aggregation instead. With the
hyper-parameter optimized architecture, the mean aggregation performs best. The
results are still similar when using the same `120-60-agg-160` architecture for
every aggregation method. The results of [@fig:resmpsmall; @fig:resmpopt]
indicate that the Bayesian aggregation outperforms the mean aggregation when the
neural network is limited in size, but has no advantage when the neural network
is sufficiently large and deep. The neural network seems to be able to
implicitly learn to transform and weigh the information from the different
observables, compensating the advantage of the additional structure of relevancy
/ certainty that is given in the Bayesian aggregation.

@Fig:resmpopttop shows the results of the top third of runs. The performance of
the mean and Bayesian aggregation is similar, indicating that the best runs are
similar, but that the Bayesian aggregation has more runs that fail to achieve
the peak performance.

@Fig:pursuiteg shows the first 500 steps of a random episode with the
medium-performing policy and the best-performing policy of each of the
aggregation methods. The mean aggregation tends to learn policies where first
all the evaders are forced to go to one location, then they are circled and
caught all at once. Since the evaders are algorithmically controlled and always
go to the largest free Voronoi region, the evaders naturally go to the same
location if they have enough space, so this strategy works well. The strategy of
the Bayesian aggregation policy seems to be more flexible, where different
groups of pursuers catch different groups of evaders at the same time instead of
all concentrating on a single cluster of evaders. This strategy does not lead to
better overall performance, however.

### Assembly task

The assembly task is different from the previous tasks in that the agents have
to manipulate the environment in order reach their goal. In order to solve the
task, the agents need to show collaborative skills in deciding on the final
destination of the assembled cluster of objects as well as succeed in moving the
objects to that location. They also need to understand when the goal has been
reached in order to not move the boxes apart again. @Fig:resassembly shows the
results on the assembly task with ten agents and four boxes. The three
aggregation methods perform very similar, with the attentive aggregation
learning the task slightly quicker.

![Results on the assembly task.](images/plots/2021-07-22_17.44.09-assembly (by
agg method).svg){#fig:resassembly}

### Clustering task with two clusters

The clustering task is an extension of the assembly task with a _third_
aggregation group for the second cluster of objects. To successfully solve this
task, the agents need to be able to distinguish between the two object types and
split the work of moving them. @Fig:resclustering2 shows the results on the
clustering task with four boxes split into two clusters. The results are similar
in all cases, with all policies solving the task for most runs. An example of a
successful episode with mean aggregation is shown in @fig:clustering2.

![Results on the clustering task with two clusters. The attentive aggregation starts learning slightly faster, but has a lower final result.](images/plots/2021-07-10_18.56.32-Clustering
task (2 clusters, by agg method).svg){#fig:resclustering2}

### Clustering task with three clusters

We can extend the clustering task to have any number of boxes in any number of
clusters, making it more difficult. We find that when extending the task to
three clusters, none of our trained policies manage to adequately solve the
task. In most cases, the agents only move the boxes of one cluster, manage to
mostly move those boxes to their target location, but then stay in the corner
completely ignore the boxes in the other clusters. Only when increasing the
number of trajectories per training step and the batch size to 10x the size used
in the other experiments does a policy consider boxes in multiple clusters (see
@sec:appendixhyper). @Fig:clustering3 shows an episode with some unsuccessful
episodes and with the best policy trained with Bayesian aggregation. Even the
best policy only considers two of the three clusters and ignores boxes in the
third cluster. The agents stay in the respective corner even though half the
episode time is remaining. Since the task is not solved, we do not provide a
comparison graph of the different aggregation methods.

![Example episodes with four different policies on the clustering task with 3 clusters, in ascending order of performance. In most cases, the policy ignores two clusters (policy 1 and 2). Only with a very large batch size does it consider boxes in two clusters, though it still sometimes misses a box.](images/clustering3.drawio.svg){#fig:clustering3}

## Learning algorithm comparison (PPO vs PG-TRL)

In multi-agent fully cooperative tasks, the reward can be even more sparse than
it is for single-agent tasks, since the same reward is used for all agents. One
agent can thus not know whether its own actions or the actions of a different
agent lead to a specific reward signal. Trust region layers policy gradient
(TRL) (see [@sec:trl]) was published for single-agent reinforcement learning,
but since TRL promises to improve the exploration over PPO and possibly find a
better optimal solution, we apply it to our multi-agent experiments in a direct
comparison to PPO.

In the following, we show some training graphs of the TRL training method
compared to PPO. @Fig:resmptrl shows the learning algorithm comparison on the
multi-evader pursuit task. The architectures are the ones hyper-parameter
optimized on PPO on each of the aggregation methods. TRL seems to show
significantly improved training performance for the Bayesian aggregation and
similar performance for the mean aggregation.

<!-- @Fig:resmptrltop
shows the same result for only the top one third of runs. The results are very
similar. This indicates that TRL makes the training more stable on this task,
fewer runs fail to achieve the optimal performance. -->

![TRL vs PPO learning algorithms on the multi-evader pursuit task. For Bayesian aggregation, the training is faster, and the end result better. For mean aggregation, the results are fairly similar.](images/plots/2021-07-22_16.26.13-Multi-Evader

-->

@Fig:ressptrl shows the comparison on the single-evader pursuit task. Here, the
performance of TRL is better than PPO on both the mean and the Bayesian
aggregation.

![TRL vs PPO learning algorithms on single-evader pursuit task. The performance of TRL is better for both the mean and the Bayesian aggregation.](images/plots/2021-07-15_12.57.59-Single-evader
Pursuit TRL vs PPO.svg){#fig:ressptrl}

@Fig:resasstrl shows the comparison on the assembly task. All aggregation
methods perform the same, except the Bayesian aggregation with TRL, which is
worse.

![TRL vs PPO learning algorithms on the assembly task. The training performance is the same for all aggregation methods, except that the Bayesian aggregation performs worse with TRL.](images/plots/2021-07-11_13.13.37-assembly
(by train algo and agg method).svg){#fig:resasstrl}

In summary, TRL seems to perform the same or better than PPO in most cases, with
the Bayesian aggregation on the assembly task being an outlier. Since we did not
do extensive testing with different hyper-parameters for TRL, we can conclude
that TRL may have good potential of performing better, in general, than PPO on
multi-task environments with sparse rewards.

## Bayesian aggregation variants

In the results comparing the different aggregation methods above, we always use
the same setup for the Bayesian aggregation. The following shows the results for
some variants of the Bayesian aggregation on selected tasks.

### Single space vs separate space aggregation

For tasks where we have multiple aggregation groups, we can also aggregate all
observables into the same latent space instead of separate ones. This means that
instead of each aggregation space containing the information of those
aggregatables, the single aggregation space must contain the information of all
observables as it pertains to the current agent. The potential advantage is that
the policy can share more parameters and thus be more sample efficient. It can
also scale to a larger number of categories of objects (aggregation groups).
@Fig:sameseparate shows a schematic comparison between the two methods.

In the other experiments we always use separate spaces. @Fig:ressameseparate
shows the results of aggregating into a single space vs. into separate spaces
for the multi-evader pursuit and assembly tasks. In the case of the multi-evader
pursuit task single-space aggregation means that both the neighboring pursuers
and all the evaders are aggregated into one space. For the assembly task, both
the neighboring agents and the boxes are aggregated into one space. The
separate-space aggregation performs better in both tasks, with a higher margin
in the multi-evader task.

In summary, while the single-space aggregation is promising by in theory being
able to scale to more complex environment, it performs worse for our tasks. This
might be due to the fact that learning different encoder networks to output
information into the same latent space is hard. An alternative explanation might
be that our experiments only have few aggregation groups, so the value of
parameter sharing is low, or due to the lack of experiments with more different
hyper-parameters.

![Schematic comparison of separate space vs. single-space aggregation. In single-space aggregation the encoders are still separate, but the latent space is shared. The single-space aggregation shares more parameters and can scale better to more aggregation groups.](images/model-sameseparate.drawio.svg){#fig:sameseparate}

![Separate vs single-space aggregation on the multi-evader pursuit and assembly tasks. The single-space aggregation performs worse in both tasks.](images/plots/2021-07-22_16.05.47-samespace.svg){#fig:ressameseparate}

![Assembly task same space comparison](images/plots/2021-07-14_13.19.13-Assembly
samespace.svg){#fig:ressameseparate2}

-->

### Separate vs common encoder

As described in @sec:bayesianagg, we can either have a shared encoder to predict
the mean and variance of each sample in each aggregation space by making the
last layer of the encoder have two outputs for each feature, or have two fully
separate networks ($enc_r$ and $enc_Ï$). In our experiments, using one common
encoder with two outputs generally performs better.

### Using the aggregated variance or only the mean

In the other experiments with Bayesian aggregation, we only use the predicted
mean of the Gaussian distribution of each latent space feature as an input to
the decoder:

$$e_{kâG}=Î¼_z$$

Since the Bayesian aggregation also gives us a full a-posteriori Gaussian
distribution, we also have an estimate of the variance for each feature in the
latent space that is computed from the apriori variance conditioned on each seen
latent space sample. We can feed this variance to the decoder by concatenating
it with the mean predictions in the hope that the neural network is able to use
this additional information:

$$e_{kâG}=(Î¼_z, Ï_z^2)$$

The results of applying this method to the multi-evader pursuit are seen in
@fig:resoutputvariance. The neural network architecture is the same as for the
other experiments with Bayesian aggregation on multi-evader pursuit
(`120-60-agg-160`). Including the variance in the decoder inputs decreases the
performance.

The decreasing performance could be a result of the increased dimension of the
decoder inputs. Adding the variance inputs doubles the number of values the
decoder has to process and learn from. Since the structure of the encoded values
and variances can not be known beforehand to the decoder, it has to learn to
interpret more information than when receiving just the mean values. The added
variance inputs should give the decoder the ability to understand the confidence
of each of the value predictions and weigh them accordingly, but the added
complexity seems to make it not worth it.

![Results of Bayesian aggregation on the multi-evader pursuit task, depending on whether the variance is also fed into the decoder or only the mean.](images/plots/2021-07-22_18.16.40-Pursuit

# Conclusion and Future Work {#sec:conclusion}

## Conclusion

We have made a comprehensive comparison between the performance of mean
aggregation, Bayesian aggregation, and attentive aggregation to collect a
varying number of observations on a set of different deep reinforcement learning
tasks. We have observed that there is no clear advantage of one of the methods
over the others, with the results differing strongly between the different
tasks. In addition, the signal to noise ratio of the comparisons was fairly low,
since other hyperparameters like the sizes of the neural networks or the
training step size changed the results more than did the chosen aggregation
method.

<!-- In general, the signal to noise ratio of the experiments was pretty low, -->

We have also shown the results of a few variants of the Bayesian aggregation and
concluded that it performs best when (1) encoding the variance with the same
encoder as the estimate instead of with separate encoders, (2) aggregating
observables of different kinds into separate latent spaces instead of the same
one and (3) not using the aggregated variance as an input to the decoder.

Finally, we have applied a new training method (trust region layers) to
multi-agent reinforcement learning and compared it to the commonly used PPO. The
results indicate that TRL is usually at least as good as PPO and in some cases
outperforms it, indicating that it may be a good alternative to PPO for
environments with sparse rewards, as is the case in many MARL tasks.

## Future Work

There are many avenues for future work in this area.

All of our experiments used global visibility due to the noisy nature of limited
local visibility making it harder to make any strong conclusions. Since the
local visibility case also increases the uncertainty of each observation though,
it might be a case where Bayesian aggregation performs better. Future work
should include experiments that have a larger environment with observability
limited by range or by obstacles. We also only considered fully cooperative
environments with a common reward. The same aggregation methods might be
beneficial for other kinds of environments, including team-based and adversarial
ones.

Even though we show in our experiments that Bayesian aggregation into the same
latent space is worse than aggregating into separate spaces, there might be
potential with this and the other variants of Bayesian aggregation we introduced
to be able to scale the number of aggregation groups more. This could be
accomplished with more hyperparameter tuning or by introducing a two-stage
encoder where the first encoder is separate by aggregation group and the second
encoder is shared, then aggregating the output of the second encoder into the
same space.

We also only considered tasks with implicit communication â the agents had to
infer the intent of the other agents purely by their actions. There is related
work that adds explicit communication between agents that is learned together
with the policy. This is usually implemented as another action output that is
written directly into the observation of the other agents instead of affecting
the world. Explicit communication architectures may be able to handle some tasks
better than those with implicit communication, but they are often only
applicable to environments with exactly two agents. For more agents, the
performance of explicit communication architectures may be affected by the
aggregation methods used and thus might be a use case for Bayesian aggregation.
